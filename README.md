## Projects
### Project 1) Simulation of neuro-controller applied to an inverse pendulum
the project carried out in MATLAB aims to balance the famous inverse pendulum problem through the use of a multilayer artificial neural network in a numerical simulation
### Project 2) Statistical analysis of the use of public money for left-wing or right-wing parties
In this project I wanted to answer a simple question: do the political parties of the right or the left have a real statistical difference in how they use public money for investments in the administered territory?
for this project I acquired the public data of the investments of each party for each year for each category for each Italian municipality, from the page (http://storico.openbilanci.it), and after a brief cleaning I evaluated the annual trend and calculated the categories that showed a statistical difference using the "t-student" test

### Project 3) Real time calculation of rental values for houses at auction in milan
The aim of this project is to create a programme capable of monitoring and estimating (using linear regression) the rental prices of houses in Milan (using the website https://www.immobiliare.it) at the exact moment the program is running, analysing all the houses at auction at this time and finally calculating (using the linear regression model used above) the possible rental value of all the houses at auction in milan in order to help a possible real estate agency or investor assess the best returns from the rental of houses at auction
