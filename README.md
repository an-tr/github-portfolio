# Data Analyst Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio.

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data scraping, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, presentation skills, machine learning,  etc. A majority of my projects are done using Python . Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, sklearn, scipy.

In the following sections, I will provide brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Letâ€™s get started!

## Projects
### Project1) Statistical analysis of the use of public money for left-wing or right-wing parties
In this project I wanted to answer a simple question: do the political parties of the right or the left have a real statistical difference in how they use public money for investments in the administered territory?
for this project I acquired the public data of the investments of each party for each year for each category for each Italian municipality, from the page (http://storico.openbilanci.it), and after a brief cleaning I evaluated the annual trend and calculated the categories that showed a statistical difference using the "t-student" test
